## User Personas

1.
Persona: Single mom
Who are they: A busy 30 y/o mom of two children who works a time-consuming job and doesn't have much time to cook nor be home when her kids come home from school.
Their main goal: She's worried that when she can't make food to leave at home, her children won't know how to make their own food, and she wants to deliver food to the house 10-20 minutes after her childrens' predicted drop-off time from the bus.
Their main barrier to achieving this goal: She's too busy at the time her children come home to order food. The restaurant she always orders from, since it's her children' favorite, doesn't allow her to schedule a specific delivery time.

2.
Persona: Construction worker
Who are they: A big and strong construction worker who loves going to the gym and is currently on a lean bulk
Their main goal: They always order from a restaurant online, but they feel that the meals they like don't have enough protein for their macronutrient goals, so they want to add more chicken to the meal to increase their daily protein intake while keeping calories relatively low to a regular bulk since chicken is low in calories compared to other meats.
Their main barrier to achieving this goal: The restaurant they go to doesn't allow them to specify what kind of meat they want to add extra of and just assumes to add extra of the meat that is part of the meal, such as beef, pork, etc.

3.
Persona: High school student athlete
Who are they: An introverted high school student athlete who is a somewhat picky eater and doesn't like a lot of vegetables
Their main goal: She dislikes phone calls and is always busy with practice, so she wants to be able to order food online to deliver to her practice field and specify from the ingredients what vegetables she would like to exclude

4.
Persona: An older 65 y/o man
Who are they: An older 65 y/o man loves spicy foods, but tends to have a grumpy attitude when he takes too long to read the menu and find all of the spicy foods
Their main goal: He wants to be able to know what spicy foods the restaurant serves quickly and efficiently without having to look so closely for "spicy" symbols next to food names
Their main barrier to achieving this goal: He has quite a severe vision problem that makes it difficult for him to read the small "spicy" symbols on menus
