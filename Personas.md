## User Personas

### 1.<br>
**Persona:** Single Mom<br>
**Who are they:** A busy 30 y/o mom of two children who works a time-consuming job and doesn't have much time to cook nor be home when her kids come home from school.<br>
**Their main goal:** She's worried that when she can't make food to leave at home, her children won't know how to cook their own food, and she wants to deliver food to the house 10-20 minutes after her childrens' predicted drop-off time from the bus.<br>
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** She's too busy at the time her children come home to order food. The restaurants she always orders from online, since it's her children' favorites, don't allow her to schedule a specific delivery time.

### 2.<br>
**Persona:** Construction Worker<br>
**Who are they:** A big, strong construction worker who loves going to the gym and is currently on a lean bulk diet.<br>
**Their main goal:** He always orders from a restaurant online, but the meals he likes don't have enough protein for his macronutrient goals, so he wants to add more chicken to the meal to increase his daily protein intake while keeping calories relatively low to a regular bulk since chicken is low in calories compared to other meats.<br>
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** The restaurant he usually orders from doesn't allow him to specify what kind of meat he wants to add extra of. Rather, it just assumes to add extra portions of the meat that is part of the existing meal, such as adding more beef to a beef and rice dish.

### 3.<br>
**Persona:** High School Student aAthlete<br>
**Who are they:** An introverted high school student athlete who is a somewhat picky eater and doesn't like a lot of vegetables.<br>
**Their main goal:** She dislikes phone calls and is always busy with practice, so she wants to be able to order food online to deliver to her practice field and specify from the ingredients which vegetables she would like to exclude from her meal.<br>
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** Her favorite restaurant she orders from doesn't allow her to exclude items from the meal description online, so she always has to call in and tell restaurant staff directly, but sometimes she'll pack her own food to practice just so she doesn't have to call in.

### 4.<br>
**Persona:** Older 65 year-Old Man<br>
**Who are they:** An older 65 y/o man loves spicy foods, but tends to have a grumpy attitude when he takes too long to read the menu and find all of the spicy foods on there.<br>
**Their main goal:** He wants to know what spicy foods the restaurant serves quickly and efficiently without having to look so closely for "spicy" symbols next to food names.<br>
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** He has quite a severe vision problem that makes it difficult for him to read the small "spicy" symbols on menus. The restaurant he enjoys ordering from online only has these "spicy" symbols next to food names on the menu to indicate that they are spicy, so when he gets too grumpy, he gives up and orders from another restaurant.

### 5.<br>
**Persona:** Restaurant Cashier<br>
**Who are they:** A cashier who works at popular takeout restaurant.
**Their main goal:** Take customer orders quickly and accurately to send to the receipt printer in the kitchen for the chefs to cook.
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** One problem is that the online ordering system doesn't allow choosing item quantity directly, so the cashier has to repeatedly drag a food item several times to the user list to specify quantity.

### 6.<br>
**Persona:** Restaurant Manager<br>
**Who are they:** A manager of a busy restaurant.
**Their main goal:** For a given day, wants to number each order, have a way to view each order, and to have a count of the total number of orders.
**Their main barrier to achieving this goal:** The online ordering system does not keep track of previous orders. The manager could accomplish this goal manually by counting the receipts, but that takes a really long time. Plus, if there is a customer dispute during the day, the manager must search through the receipt stack again for that customer's order, which can lead to impatience in an already emotionally charged situation.
