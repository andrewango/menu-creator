## What We Learned
We learned about Git version control, page routing, and using React state, interfaces, and passing props between components. We used React Drag-N-Drop, React Router, and ChakraUI to implement much of our website's functionality. Since we did not have a backend, Session Storage was our go-to to maintain and transfer data across pages.
